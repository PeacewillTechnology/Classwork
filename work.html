    <p>The Lagos State Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court in Ikeja has sentenced a cleric, Bishop Oluwafeyiropo Daniels, to life in prison for the offence of raping a pastor in his church, “I Reign Christian Ministry” in June 2020.

        The Court also found Mr. Daniels guilty of the offence of sexual assault of two members of his church and sentenced to three years in prison.
        
        Delivering judgment, Justice Rahman Oshodi said he believed the testimony of the complainant as well as other witnesses who gave direct evidence which weren’t contradicted at any point during the trial, despite the denials of the defendant.
        
        The court also held that the prosecution had successfully proven all the ingredients of rape under section 260(2) of the criminal laws of Lagos state, 2015.
        
        But Justice Oshodi discharged the defendant of the second count of allegedly raping another church member at his home in 2020.

        <p>In day 2 of it’s enforcement, the Lagos state government is clearing all shanties and illegal shops located within the Mandilas market area.

            This, the government said, is to give way for access roads for emergency responders to access whenever there is an incident.
            
            Recall that a fire incident engulfed the second and seventh floor in Mandilas, destroying goods and property worth millions of naira.
            
            Emergency responders had a hard time getting into the market to quench the fire on time.
            
            Several stores and shops were subsequently sealed to allow emergency responders to gain entrance into the affected building.</p>
